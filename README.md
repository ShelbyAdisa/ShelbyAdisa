💫 About Me:
Hey, I’m Shelby

I build web apps with React, Django, and PostgreSQL

I’m big on clean UI, solid backend logic, and writing code that doesn’t fall apart six months later. I care about doing things the right way — structure first, polish second.

Currently building full-stack projects, exploring scalable product ideas, and leveling up as a frontend-leaning engineer.

If it’s useful, maintainable, and well-designed, I’m interested.
